      <p>
        Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) generate vast amounts of sensor and telemetry data 
        that must be reliably stored as a "black box" for forensic analysis, regulatory compliance, 
        and continuous learning. However, the harsh vibrational environment inside a moving vehicle 
        presents significant challenges to conventional storage systems, leading to data corruption, 
        mechanical failures, and reduced device lifespans.

      <p>
        Existing solutions either sacrifice storage capacity for durability or fail to adapt to 
        varying vibration profiles encountered during real-world driving. There is a critical need 
        for a storage architecture that dynamically adjusts its write strategies and error-correction 
        mechanisms based on real-time vibration sensing, while maintaining high throughput and 
        storage efficiency.
